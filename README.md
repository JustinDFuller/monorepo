# monorepo

I've moved all my recent projects into this repo in order to organize my code (share it, publish it, etc.) from one central location and without recreating things all the time.

## Apps

These are full apps. They may be a mobile app, web app, or just a backend.

## Aws-Lambda-Services

My services will be using lambda services in order to have a more flexible and simple architecture going forward. Services for apps should be found here. They should hopefully use shared code elsewhere and just implement it.

## Packages

All utilities and shareable code that isn't specific business logic or presentation logic.

## Tutorials

Tutorials go here so that they can used shared code as well.

TODO:

- [ ] Global babel.
- [ ] Global Eslint.
- [ ] Shared packages.
- [ ] Shared Components.

## Packages

All packages are scoped to `@justindfuller` on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=scope:justindfuller&page=1&ranking=optimal).
